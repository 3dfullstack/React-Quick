[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/efebf3ed-578f-4ee7-aebb-97cd0cb70ea3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reactfullstack/deploys)

`MERN`, `MEAN`, &amp; `PERN`  Stack Code Snippets. Also contains some `ES6` Examples. For backend, I tried covering my most used code snippets/examples in `Node.js`, `Socket.io`, `Redis`, `PostgreSQL`, `Prisma`, `Express` & other frameworks.
